And in that sense, sort of… And you and I, a couple of weeks ago had a little bit of an exchange. Like, I look at when Adobe went from Adobe Test&Target and everybody thought of them as testing platform to Adobe Target that part of that’s what they’ve been… Even Adobe, and I guess Google probably as well, I don’t wanna go down the vendor path. But this idea that you know a bunch of things about your visitors and some of the stuff matters and some of it doesn’t, and there’s a limited number of things you can control, either because you haven’t created content to provide various options or it’s just not something that makes any sense to be changed or the infrastructure doesn’t support it.
